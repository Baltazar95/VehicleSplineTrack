# VehicleSplineTrack
Vehicle Spline Track is a UE4 project that is aimed at creating a spline track and a vehicle able to go through it as long as it has fuel. Along the course the vehicle should drift on curves to win score and respect traffic lights (unless they are in the yellow light, in that case is pedal to the metal).
